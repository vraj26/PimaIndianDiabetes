# Pima Indians Diabetes
Applying Ensemble Learning technique onto training data to determine accuracy of AdaBoost and XGBoost models.

## Problem Statement
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurement included in the dataset.
All patients are females of at least 21 years of age and of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.
Predictor variagbles include the number of pregnancies the patients have had, their BMI, their insulin level, age, and so on.

## Key Steps
1. Building 2 different models using AdaBoost and XGBoost respectfully
2. Evaluting and comparing the accuracies of the classifiers
